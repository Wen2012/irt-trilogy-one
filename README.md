IRT-Trilogy One
=======

I was always wondering if I can constantly write a book about my journey of learning Item Response Theory and Reading Assessment. Because when these two parts joined together, things would become complicated with more and more layers of theoretical interpretation. If one profound theory can not be talking in a simple and elegant way, why we allow that one bother us? 

The goal of This book is simple - tell you and tell me what is Item Response Theory. IRT would not necessarily relate to any aspects of psychometrics, but it can be used a hinge for connecting statistics, models, sampling, machine learning, data visualization and web application. Then, when we come back to our research questions in reading assessment, we should have a toolbox full of awesome tools.

This Trilogy is designed to reflect my way of learning psychometrics at different stages- Pre, Ongoing and Post IRT learning. Thus, the trilogy is picked to organize the ideas and concepts of Item response theory.
