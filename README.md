IRT-Trilogy One
=======

I was always wondering if I can constantly write a book about my journey of learning Item Response Theory and Reading Assessment. Because when these two parts joined together, things would become complicated with more and more layers of theoretical interpretation. If one profound theory can not be talking in a simple and elegant way, why we allow that one bother us? 

The goal of This book is simple - tell you and tell me what is Item Response Theory. IRT would not necessarily relate to any aspects of psychometrics, but it can be used a hinge for connecting statistics, models, sampling, machine learning, data visualization and web application. Then, when we come back to our research questions in reading assessment, we should have a toolbox full of awesome tools.

This Trilogy is designed to reflect my way of learning psychometrics at different stages- Pre, Ongoing and Post IRT learning. Thus, the trilogy is picked to organize the ideas and concepts of Item response theory. 


Some learning notes from the Handbook of Multivariate Experimental Psychology by Catetell, 1966
## Chapter 4
Horst(1966) proposed that the scientific investigation consists of the following parts:
theoretical theme
relational system
experimental design

statistical methods

From taxonomy to "fitness", then he reviewed the commonly used methods:
1. **Multiple regression**, the joint relating of many variables to one;
2. **Canonical correlation** (and such problems as the most predictable criterion), in which  a function of many variables is related to a function of another plurality
3. **Factor analysis**, the resolution of many variables into fewer;
4. **Multiple analysis of variance**, looking for significance of relation of several independent and several dependent variables. 
5. **Differential prediction**, magnifying differences of prediction and selection rather than concerning oneself with absolute prediction.
6. **Multidimensional scaling**, a relative of factor analysis. 
7. **Multiple discriminant functions**, maximizing the separation of individuals on pre-assigned groupings. 
8. **Configural and type analysis**, discovering natually existing segregations of entities in groups by various dimensional properties, including measuring the 'distance apart' of individuals.
9. **Latent class analysis**, a further form of "typing" with special restrictions;
10. **Study of the action of modifier variables and modulator action
**, i.e. the change in relations of two variables according to level oa third, etc.





###**Some concepts in multivariate analysis**
* objects and **attributes**
* replication - "off-sets", the extensions of a two-dimensional matrix or facets in directions orthogonal to itself (Data Box by Cattell, 1966)



**attributes-** 
* predictor/independent/variables
* criterion/dependent variables
* distruber varaibles

** Metric **
 * origins of zero and standard deviation
 * some multivariate analysis procedures are independent of unit and origin of measurement, or or linear transformation.
 * linear relationships among the variables involved
 * methos of making non-linear transformation of simple variables:
    *  transcendental functions such as logarithmic, trigonometric or exponential
    *  area transformation, convert arbitrary distributions to rectangular or normal form - table or polynomial transformation
